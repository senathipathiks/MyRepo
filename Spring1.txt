Spring
 
	-Framework
	-Light weight
	-template
	-loosely coupled
	-IOC(Inversion of Control)
	-Proper MVC
	-Easy to test
	-AOP
 
-Introduction
		- Lightweight and popular open-source
		- Java-based framework developed by Rod Johnson 2003
		- Used to develop enterprise-level application
		- Support to many other framework such as Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, Struts,etc, so it also called a framework of framework
		- It's an application framework and IOC container for the the java platform
		-It contians serval modules like a IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, Web MVC, etc.
	-Advantages
		-Lightwieght
		-predefined template
		-Loose Coupling
		-Easy to test
		-Fast development
		-Integration with other frameworks
		-Well defined MVC Frame work
	-Architecture of Spring Framework
	-Bean
		-It is an Object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IOC Container
	-Scopes
		-Singleton
			-Only one bean
		-Prototype
`			-New bean for Each request
		-request
		-Session
		-Global-session
	-Lifecycle of Bean
		-Bean Instantiated
		-Dependencies Injection
		-Init()
		-Utility method
		-destroy()
		
	-Constructor Injection & setter Injection
	
	- Annotation Based
	
	-Spring Bean Lifecycle CheatSheet
		-Bean Definitions are declared
		-Bean Definitions are Loaded
		-Bean Definitions are processed
		-Beans are instantiated
		-Dependencies are injected
		-Neans are post processed 
		-Beans are initailised
		-Beans are Post Processed
		-Beans live in application context
		-bean are destroyed
-Dependency Injection
		-it is a design pattern used to create loosely coupled componets in a software application
		-Avoid modifying the application.
	-Uses of DI:
		-Code Maintainability
		-Testability
		-Scalability
	-Constructor Injection 
	-Setter Injection
	-Annotation
		-no need of XML Class
	-Core Annotations
		-@component
			-Class level
		-@Bean
			-method
		-@Configuration
	-Auto Wired
	-Annotations:
		-@Configuration 
			-Class-based annotation that define one or more bean method in the class
			-Java Developers can write codes by replacing large XML configuration files.
		-@Autowired
			-used to inject the dependency of one into another
		-@Bean
			-Method-level annotation
			-To create and manage beans
		-@Component
			-Used to mark the java class in the Spring application
			-Turns the class into a spring bean at the auto-scan time.
		-@ComponentScan
			-It is an annotation used in the spring Framework for auto-detecting and registering Spring - Managed components
		-@Controller 
			-controller are responsible for processing user request returning the response
		-@service
			-Perfrom business logic operation within a spring application, represents the service layer
		-@Repository
		
	-Spring MVC
		-Model View Controller
		-Model 2
 
	-Model
		-It is an interface in the spring core package under com.springframework.ui
		-It is used for transferring the data or attributes from our business logic to the rebering view pages.
	-ModelMap
		-Model is a Class in the spring core package under com.springFrameWork.
		-It is used for transferring the data or attribute from our buiness logic to the rendering view pages
