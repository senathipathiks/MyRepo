Exercise:3

Create a servlet and name it as FileUploader.
Create an html/jsp file with a form with fields for uploading a file and a check box for allowing overwrite.
Uploads folder should be named uploads and should be immediately under the WEB-INF folder.
The FileUploader servlet should check if there is already a file with the name specified in the uploads folder first.
If there is a file and Overwrite is checked, then write, and return message 'File is Overwritten'.
If there is a file and Overwrite is NOT checked, return a message that 'File already exist and Overwrite not checked.'
If there is no file with same name, write the file and return a message that 'File Written.'
